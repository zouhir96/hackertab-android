# Welcome to contributing guide 

Thank you for investing your time in our project!

If you want to contribute to a project and make it better, your help is very welcome. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social coding on Github, new technologies, and their ecosystems, and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests, and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request.

Before starting your feature, it's preferable to add an issue to keep track of your dev. 


### How to make a clean pull request

Look for a project's contribution instructions. If there are any, follow them.

- Create a personal fork of the project on GitHub.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! A branch from `dev`.
- Implement/fix your feature.
- Push your branch to your fork on GitHub, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `dev` branch.
- If the maintainer requests further changes just push them to your branch. The PR will be updated automatically.
- Once the pull request is approved and use `Squash and merge` for adding your feature to `upstream`. 
- Now, you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete
your extra branch(es).


A detailed pull request flow is described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects).
